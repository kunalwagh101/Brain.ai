## Sprint planning

Increment 6 goal: **every Slack/GitHub source actor can be represented as a tenant-scoped source identity without pretending it is a Brain user; only verified exact evidence may auto-resolve, while Owner/Admin manual resolve/reassign/unresolve actions are tenant-safe, reversible and immutably audited.**

Vertical slice: source-identity/history schema -> canonical actor observation -> exact verified-email resolver -> unresolved/conflict states -> Owner/Admin identity-management API -> canonical resolved-user reference -> reconciliation for existing canonical events -> tests/migration/docs/UAT.

## Increment 5 review

- Added schema-versioned canonical events with one canonical row per raw event and immutable raw-event provenance.
- Slack and GitHub now map into the same actor/action/object/source/permissions/provenance contract.
- Unsupported or malformed mappings are quarantined; raw source evidence remains intact instead of being silently discarded.
- GitHub uses a verified GitHub App installation flow rather than PATs or arbitrary client-supplied installation IDs.
- Brain-signed expiring state binds the initiating Brain organisation/user; a second signed selection token binds the verified GitHub installation/account choice.
- A selected installation is re-fetched and verified as belonging to the configured GitHub App before it is connected.
- The generic integration endpoint rejects `provider=github`, preventing bypass of the verified GitHub App flow.
- GitHub App private key, OAuth client secret and webhook secret are loaded by secret reference; installation access tokens are short-lived and are not persisted.
- Webhooks validate `X-Hub-Signature-256` against the exact raw body before parsing; `X-GitHub-Delivery` provides retry-safe idempotency.
- Private/internal repository evidence carries `github:repository:<id>` source ACL provenance for the later retrieval-authorisation layer.
- GitHub backfill walks repository metadata, commits, pull requests, issues and deployments using a signed, connection-bound, replay-safe cursor.
- Alembic revision `20260906_0006` adds provider metadata and canonical event storage with downgrade support.
- Backend CI passed lint and 73 tests on GitHub Actions run `34037248953`.
- Delivery Verifier passed on run `34037248958` before engineering-DONE was claimed; the final DONE-state gate also passed before merge.
- F-02.03 and F-03.02 remain `UAT_PENDING`; they are not called passed/accepted until real GitHub/Slack data and frontend/manual UAT are recorded.

## Session-open self-audit

- Eight stories are engineering-DONE; user acceptance remains independently tracked in UAT.md.
- Current WIP count: 1: S-03.03.01.
- WorkOS authentication identities remain separate from Slack/GitHub source identities.
- Automatic source-identity linking requires provider-verified exact evidence inside the same organisation; incomplete evidence remains unresolved.
- No fuzzy name/username/domain/LLM guessing is allowed for automatic identity resolution.
- No second story will enter IN_PROGRESS until this identity slice leaves WIP unless the board explicitly re-plans it.

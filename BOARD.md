## Sprint planning

Increment 3 goal: **an authorised admin can create, inspect and safely revoke a scoped external connection without storing plaintext credentials in PostgreSQL, while connector workers have persisted health and sync-cursor state.**

Vertical slice: integration schema -> AWS Secrets Manager reference -> create/list/read/revoke API -> sync-state helpers -> negative security/error tests -> migration/rollback -> docs.

## Increment 2 review

- One Brain-owned role matrix covers owner, admin, executive, manager, member and guest.
- Restricted resources require both role capability and an explicit user ACL grant.
- Admin privilege escalation is blocked; only owners may assign owner/admin roles.
- Authorization denial and ACL changes emit structured security events.
- Slack DMs are excluded from MVP and private channels require explicit opt-in.
- Backend CI passed lint and 34 tests before merge.

## Session-open self-audit

- Previous three stories are engineering-DONE but remain UAT_PENDING until real-data backend and manual frontend acceptance are recorded.
- OQ-003 is resolved for Increment 3: AWS Secrets Manager is the first production secret backend.
- Current WIP count: 1.
- Slack/GitHub connector stories remain BACKLOG until S-02.01.01 is engineering-DONE.
